# Welcome

I am a Ph.D. student in the MDPPML and Pfeifer Groups at the University of Tübingen, where my research focuses on developing innovative methods for privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) to enhance the security and privacy of ML systems. Before my Ph.D., I earned my Master's in Computer Science from Sabancı University, where I also completed a double major in Computer Science and Electronics Engineering.
